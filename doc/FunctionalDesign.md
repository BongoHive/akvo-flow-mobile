## Functional design
The app is organised in different activities, each of which represent a functional unit of the system. Each section links to its functional design document.
* [Users](functionalDesign/Users.md) - login services, authorization, enumerator versus field manager role, user creation
* [Surveys](functionalDesign/Surveys.md) - download surveys, display and complete surveys, see statistics
* [Data Storage & Synch](functionalDesign/DataSync.md) - data storage, online and offline synchronization
* [Monitoring features](functionalDesign/MonitoringFeatures.md) - downloading and updating existing data
* [Languages](functionalDesign/Languages.md) - multi-lingual display of surveys and user interface
* [RemoteManagement](functionalDesign/RemoteManagement.md) - updating the app, reporting exceptions to the server

## User roles
We have defined a number of user roles, representing ways that people with different roles can interact with the system. Each roles has a detailed description in the form of a persona. The user roles are:
* [Enumerator](userRoles/Enumerator.md)
* [Field Manager](userRoles/FieldManager.md)
* [Dashboard Admin](userRoles/DashboardAdmin.md)
* [Akvo staff](userRoles/AkvoStaff.md)

## User Stories
For each user type, we have collected a number of user stories, reflecting the way the different users interact with the system. They can be found here:
* [Enumerator](userStories/Enumerator.md)
* [Field Manager](userStories/FieldManager.md)
* [Dashboard Admin](userStories/DashboardAdmin.md)
* [Akvo staff](userStories/AkvoStaff.md)
